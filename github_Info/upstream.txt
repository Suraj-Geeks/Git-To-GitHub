What do you mean by -u?

The -u flag in the git push command stands for "upstream". It tells Git to set the upstream reference for your local branch to the remote branch you are pushing to.

What Does git push -u origin master Do?
-u or --set-upstream: This option tells Git to associate your local branch (master in this case) with the remote branch (origin/master).
After using -u, you can simply run git push or git pull in the future, and Git will know which remote branch to push/pull from, without needing to specify origin master each time.

*How It Works:
First Push:
The first time you push a local branch to a remote (e.g., git push -u origin master), Git sets the upstream for that branch.

This means Git remembers the remote branch (origin/master), so you don’t have to type the remote and branch name each time.

Subsequent Pushes:
After setting the upstream, you can just use:git push (Git will know which branch you’re pushing to (i.e., origin/master or main))
